 Abstract:
 Controller for the main table view of the LazyTable sample.
  This table view controller works off the AppDelege's data model.
  produce a three-stage lazy load:
  1. No data (i.e. an empty table)
  2. Text-only data from the model's RSS feed
  3. Images loaded over the network asynchronously
  
  This process allows for asynchronous loading of the table to keep the UI responsive.
  Stage 3 is managed by the AppRecord corresponding to each row/cell.
  
  Images are scaled to the desired height.
  If rapid scrolling is in progress, downloads do not begin until scrolling has ended.
